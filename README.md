# losslang
Image-based EsoLang based on the meme Loss

# Inspiration
The reduced form of loss splits the image into 4 panels and each panel into more subsections.

We can treat each panel/subsection as part of an instruction set and each "comic" is run from left to right, top to bottom (i.e. the order in which a comic is read).

Furthermore, in each square more "comic"s can be embedded for instructions to be run inside of a running section.

# Specification
(work-in-progress)
